### Installation of Ubuntu 20.04
The detalied instructions on how to install Ubuntu 20.04 are documented [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-ubuntu-20-04). <br />

### Installation of ROS 2 Foxy on Ubuntu
The official steps for installing ROS are at [this link at ROS.org](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html), but I will walk you through the process below so that you can see what each step should look like. We will install ROS 2 Foxy via Debian Packages. </br>

1. The first thing we are going to do is to set the locale. You can understand what locale means [at this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale_(computer_software)).
